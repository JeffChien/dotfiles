* Dotfiles
deploy by gnu stow base on the [[http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html][link]].

I've tried 3 different ways to manage dotfiles including this one, the current one is using Mackup, it's easy to use doesn't have a clean way to remove package. while I was trying the
other dotfile system that make home folder managed by git I came across the emacs org mode
babel dotfile system then I thought I should pick up this repo again.
