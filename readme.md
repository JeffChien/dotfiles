Experimenting with using NixOS flakes to manage device environments and dotfiles.

Retiring the previous setup [archive](archive/readme.org), despite the benefits of using Org-mode for configuration documentation and its integration with Org-Babel for automated compilation, has been a fascinating and valuable experience. However, certain drawbacks have proven disruptive. The edit-build cycle is not ideally suited for managing dotfiles; I often find myself bypassing the Org file altogether by directly modifying the raw files. Portability also presents a challenge, as Emacs is not a standard application on macOS and Linux, and even a minimal installation requires considerable configuration to be usable. Ultimately, the extensive work required in Emacs Lisp proved to be the final deterrent, as it was not an enjoyable process.
